Predict the stock market price. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

The aim is to predict the future stock prices using the data from ‘N’ days. This dataset will be evaluated for better predictions using Natural Language Processing[NLP] and Machine Learning Techniques with Python to predict the future stock prices with high degree of accuracy.
